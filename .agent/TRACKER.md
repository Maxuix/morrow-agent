# Progress Tracker

## Current status

The complete Stage 5 Preference Learning v2 implementation plan is finalized after one
`$grok-delegate` review and independent plan-fix pass. S56 is now active on its dedicated branch.

## Last completed work

The original Stage 5 v12 pipeline and Subplan 55 remediation are complete. The subsequent isolated
real-Provider evaluation is committed at `c6031d2` and records:

- natural-language add/overwrite recall `0/3`;
- remove recall `0/2`;
- Mimo Review timeout under the foreground 15-second deadline;
- successful structured promotion and new-Session injection;
- stale Preference behavior in one restored existing Session.

The user accepted the refactor direction: generic atomic natural-language rules, a separate no-tool
semantic Reviewer, deterministic add/replace/remove Writer, Candidate Inbox, durable asynchronous
execution, and next-AgentRun refresh.

## Active task

S56 implementation, the one required review/fix cycle, and the final offline gates are verified;
closeout is ready.

## Next action

Commit the S56 closeout, fast-forward local `main`, retire the clean topic branch, then activate S57.
Reviewer, Writer, Worker, foreground enqueue, and automatic publication remain disabled.

## Blockers

None for S56. Real-Provider acceptance remains on hold until the refactor is implemented and the
post-implementation protocol runs.

## Preserved workspace state

`docs/research/stage5-overview-pipeline.md` and `docs/research/stage5-overview-review.md` are untracked
user files. They remain untouched and must not be included in plan or implementation commits without
explicit authorization.

## Locked boundary

- Main Agent performs the user task; background Reviewer performs Preference semantics; deterministic
  Writer mutates state only after acceptance/direct approval.
- YAML remains Active Preference authority; SQLite stores jobs, Evidence, proposals, decisions,
  write-batch recovery, and events.
- Profile and Project Knowledge remain separate; Preference injection is not MemorySelection.
- `manage_preferences` may reuse the existing configuration-write approval/recovery class, but no
  keyword semantic classifier, fixed Preference taxonomy, auto-activation, daemon, new dependency,
  bundled capability-policy default change, or public AgentEvent change is authorized.
